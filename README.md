This is an HTML5 app to plan out musical arrangements.

It's very limited and only designed for the arrangements
that I like to [work on](https://soundcloud.com/dj_bylamplight)
which are made up of repeating grooves and only a few changes.

A lot of code was lifted from [mrcoles.com/piano/](http://mrcoles.com/piano/).
